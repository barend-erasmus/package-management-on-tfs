# Package Management on TFS

You no longer need to manage legacy on-prem file shares or host private package servers. Weâ€™ll host, index, and manage your packages seamlessly in the cloud right alongside your source code, builds, and releases.

## Install

To add `Package Management` to your TFS, go to the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed) and click install. Once you've successfully installed `Package Management` you should be able to navigate to `Packages` under the `Build & Release` tab.
